- On day 3, I will be learning topics like : **States** & **Props**

- The State object is where you store property values that beong to the component. Whenever the state object changes, the component re-renders.

# useState

- In react, when you want to change something on our web page (like updating a live score), for that you need few things : 
    1. **Remember the change** : You need to remember what you want to change.
    2. **Make the change visible** : You also need  a way to show the change on your web page. If your score goes up, the weeb page should update to show the new score.


# Prop Drilling

- It is a term used in react to desribe the process of passing data from a parent component to da deeply nested child component through intermediary component to a deeply nested child component through that intermediary component.
- It can only occur when you have a component hirerarchy.

--- 
- If you want to render a component in react.js then write their name in **Upperlater** with. 
for example
```
<Dosomething />
```
