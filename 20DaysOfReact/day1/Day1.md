# What is **React**?

- React is popular _javascript_ library for building **UI**.
- Used for creating _dynamic and interactive web apps._
- It follows `component-based architecture`.

# So, why it was needed?

- Building complex UI in plain JS is kind of messy task. And not to mention when your project grows it became hard to maintain it.
    
## vite-project

    - By following this link I created my very first vite-project in javascript.
    - And also deployed it by using [vercel-cli](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/deploying-from-cli).

It was fun :).
